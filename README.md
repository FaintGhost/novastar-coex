# novastar-coex
A javascript library for control of NovaStar COEX video wall processors


# Known Issues

1. Input selection currently only works when processor is in "Send Only" working mode.  Input selection on layers when in All in One mode is not yet supported.  As soon as the API supports it, and we get documentation, it will be implemented.
